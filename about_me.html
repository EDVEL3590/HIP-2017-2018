    <div class="about">
      <p> Welcome, My name is Edgar Velazquez and I attend Canoga Park High School, as a senior. At the moment, I am involved in the HIP
        Program and my school's robotics team. Previously, I was vice president of my class and participated in JV InvenTeam, an MIT-sponsored 
        invetion club. I intend to major is physics at universities such as UCLA, UCSD, or Stanford. STEM is very interestig to me because it 
        contains the rules of the universe and helps adavance our society.
